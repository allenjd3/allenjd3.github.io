So I've talked a little about Hotwire in the past but for Laravel there is a much more ubiquitous "wire" around- [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/). Hotwire is very much a build the way you always build and then sprinkle in the magic. Livewire is more of a thought switch so I struggled with it at first. I think I've found the correct balance for it though and it comes from an article I read in the React Docs of all places: [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

Livewire is a bit of a mental switch. Its more react-like in the way it handles data. The craziest thing to me is that you don't need controllers anymore. All the business logic can be organized into components. You can even route to individual components.
