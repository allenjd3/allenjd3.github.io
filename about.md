  I make websites.
</p>

Also, lets talk about `about` pages. Does every website need an about, and contact us page? Seriously, I feel like if you have made it to this page on this site, its because you are waiting for your coffee to finish brewing or perhaps pooping. Do you really have a huge desire to read about who I am? 

There is a lot of scrolling these days. Infinite scrolling actually. Infinite scrolling is such an annoyance. Think about it- if you find something you like, you have to save it because it might not be there the next time you jump into your app and start scrolling again. And there is never a footer anymore. You can't reach the footer. Thats just a shame all around. How am I going to know whether you have an arbitrarily dated legally dubious copyright notice tacked onto the end?

Anyway, why does every company need to create an app? Why do I need an app to make a hair appointment? Just make a website people! A website without an about page. But then how would you know what their service is? Do apps have about us pages or do you just know what they are? Maybe the app store is now the about us page... 

I think I've figured out why I don't like app stores. They are giant about us pages! 

I'm surprised you are still reading this. If you've made it this far in my ramblings, you are to be commended. Or is it applauded? Perhaps both? I ask a lot of questions for an about us page. 

I suppose at this point, I should tell you a little about myself...
